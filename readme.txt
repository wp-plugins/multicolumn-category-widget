= How can I customize the style of the widget? =

All styles can be found in `css/frontend.css`.

Generally the widget supports multiple languages - you can use Loco Translate to add more languages,
if needed.

If you want to provide a translation in your language which is missing yet, you're welcome to send me the
po/mo files for the next update.
